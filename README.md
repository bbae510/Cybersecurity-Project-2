# Cybersecurity-Project-2

For our secondary project, we engaged in a penetration testing exercise. Putting our skills to the test, we were able to determine whether or not we were capable of pentesting in a mock professional environment. 

Red Team: 
- Create a topology of the network
- Assess and scan the network for any vulnerablities  
- Establish TTPs for attacks
- Exploit discovered vulnerabilities 

Blue Team: 
- Log analysis using SIEM (Kibana) 
- Identify breach 
- Establish strategies for mitigation, system hardening, and repercussions
- Harden System. Patches. Report.
